Iâ€™m excited to share my latest SQL project: Pizza Sales Data Analysis!

Using MySQL, I analyzed pizza sales trends, customer preferences, and overall business performance.

ðŸ“‚ Datasets Analyzed:

Pizza Sales
Pizza Types
Orders
Order Details
With 13 targeted SQL queries, I uncovered:

ðŸ“ˆ Key Sales Trends
ðŸŽ¯ Customer Behavior Insights
ðŸ“Š Comprehensive Business Performance Analysis
This project demonstrates the power of SQL in transforming raw data into actionable insights. Iâ€™m looking forward to applying these skills to future jobs!
